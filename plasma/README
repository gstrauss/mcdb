plasma provides portability macros for compiler and hardware micro operations.
These are short sequences of instructions which implement features provided by
hardware, though not exposed by the standard C or C++ languages.  Functionality
is achieved via use of compile intrinsics and inline assembly in order to
influence compiler and hardware processor behavior.

plasma is an abbreviation of 'PortabLe ASM Actions'.
(plasma was originally developed with name chasm (Compiler/Hardware ASseMbly),
 but there is already an old assembler from 1990s named chasm (CHeap ASseMbler))
