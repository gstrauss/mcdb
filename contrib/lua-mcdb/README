lua-mcdb 0.01


Lua interface to create and read mcdb constant databases.

The lua-mcdb extension module wraps interfaces in libmcdb.so
See https://github.com/gstrauss/mcdb/ for latest info on mcdb.
mcdb is based on D. J. Bernstein's constant database package
(see http://cr.yp.to/cdb.html).


Install
-------

mcdb must be built and installed before you can build lua-mcdb.
lua-devel package must be installed (e.g. Redhat Fedora lua-devel)
  (or build lua from src and update lua-mcdb Makefile to add -I for lua headers)

Build mcdb.so and mcdb_make.so
  $ make
  $ make test

Install mcdb.so and mcdb_make.so in your LUA_CPATH


Sample and Documentation
------------------------

See mcdblua.t for some sample usage.
Please be forewarned that lua is very new to me.
Feedback on Lua-isms is welcomed.
